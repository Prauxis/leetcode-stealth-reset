# LeetCode Stealth Reset

LeetCode Stealth Reset is a minimal Chrome extension that automatically hides the code editor on LeetCode problems you have already solved. This helps you attempt fresh solutions without being distracted by your previous code. A simple toggle button lets you show or hide the editor whenever you like.
